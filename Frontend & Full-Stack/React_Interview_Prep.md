# React — Interview Prep (Basic → Staff, with Code & Sources)

> **Target level:** Basic → Staff (graduated — see below) · **Baseline:** React 19 (current stable, released 2024-12-05; latest minor 19.2, released 2025-10-01) — function components and Hooks are treated as the default (class components covered only where a follow-up explicitly asks about legacy code); React Compiler is documented as a separate, independently-versioned project (stable v1.0 since 2025-10-07) rather than a built-in part of React itself · **Last verified:** 2026-08-24 · **Prerequisites:** core JavaScript, especially closures and array methods (see the [JavaScript guide](JavaScript_Interview_Prep.md)); no prior React experience assumed for the Basic section

How to use this: each question has a **Core answer** (100–180 words), a **Staff-level extension**, a concrete **Example**, **Follow-up questions**, and **Sources**. React's own core model (components, one-way data flow, hooks) has been stable for years, but the surrounding recommended practice has shifted meaningfully — Server Components, Actions, and the React Compiler are all relatively recent and change what "idiomatic React" looks like — so this guide is explicit about what's core-React-the-library versus what depends on a specific meta-framework (Next.js, and similar) or the separately-versioned Compiler.

## Basic

### 1. What Is React, and What Problem Does the Virtual DOM Solve?

**Core answer:**

"React is a JavaScript library, maintained by Meta, for building user interfaces out of composable components. It's scoped as a UI library, not a full application framework — that's why routing, data fetching conventions, and server rendering usually come from a separate meta-framework built on top of React, not React itself. The virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of what the UI should look like: a tree of plain JavaScript objects describing elements, not real DOM nodes. When state changes, React builds a new virtual-DOM tree, compares it against the previous one (reconciliation), and works out the minimal set of real DOM changes needed to catch up. That beats the alternatives — a developer manually tracking which DOM nodes to touch, or React just tearing down and rebuilding the whole DOM on every change — both slower and far more error-prone to hand-write."

**Staff-level extension:**

The real reason this matters, beyond "it's faster": real DOM operations (creating nodes, reflowing layout, repainting) are expensive, while diffing two in-memory JavaScript trees is cheap. So React's model lets you write declaratively — "here's what the UI should look like given this state" — without reasoning imperatively about which exact DOM nodes to touch, while still avoiding the cost of full-tree rebuilds. The virtual DOM isn't free, though — it's a trade: some diffing overhead for a much simpler programming model and less DOM churn than you'd get naively. That's also why React's newer direction, the Compiler covered later, keeps pushing on reducing unnecessary re-renders further — the virtual DOM was never meant to be the final word on performance.

**Example:**

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
// On each click, React builds a new virtual-DOM tree for this component,
// diffs it against the previous one, and updates only the button's text node —
// it does not recreate the <button> element itself.
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Is React a framework or a library, and why does that distinction matter here?"* — React itself only handles the UI-component layer. Routing, data fetching conventions, and SSR come from separate libraries or a meta-framework like Next.js built on top of it — a different scope than an all-in-one framework, which affects how a team assembles its tooling.
- *"Does the virtual DOM mean React is always faster than directly manipulating the real DOM?"* — No. Hand-optimized, targeted DOM manipulation for a narrow, known case can beat React's general-purpose diffing. The virtual DOM's value is making a broadly-fast, declarative default achievable without that manual work for most UI code.

### 2. What Is JSX, and How Does It Become Actual DOM Elements?

**Core answer:**

"JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that lets you write UI structure in an HTML-like syntax directly inside JavaScript, instead of calling `React.createElement()` by hand for every element. JSX isn't valid JavaScript on its own — a build tool (Babel, or the compiler built into a bundler like Vite) transforms it at build time into plain `React.createElement()` calls, or, with the newer JSX transform, calls to functions imported automatically from `react/jsx-runtime`. Either way, it produces plain JavaScript objects describing the UI — the virtual-DOM elements from the previous question, not real DOM nodes yet. Because JSX compiles down to regular function calls and plain objects, it can embed arbitrary JavaScript expressions inside curly braces (`{count}`, `{items.map(...)}`). That's exactly what makes conditional and list rendering in JSX just ordinary JavaScript, not a separate templating language with its own rules."

**Staff-level extension:**

The mechanical detail worth stating exactly: `<div className="box">{title}</div>` compiles to something like `React.createElement('div', { className: 'box' }, title)`, or under the modern automatic JSX runtime, `jsx('div', { className: 'box', children: title })`. That call never touches the real DOM — it just returns a plain JavaScript object describing what should eventually render. That's why conditional rendering in JSX uses plain operators (`condition && <Component />`, a ternary) instead of a special directive syntax: the content inside `{}` is just a JavaScript expression being evaluated, same as anywhere else in the language, with no separate template grammar to learn.

**Example:**

```jsx
// JSX as written:
const element = <h1 className="greeting">Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;

// Roughly what it compiles to (automatic JSX runtime, React 17+):
import { jsx } from 'react/jsx-runtime';
const element = jsx('h1', { className: 'greeting', children: `Hello, ${user.name}!` });

// Conditional/list rendering is just plain JavaScript expressions inside {}:
function ItemList({ items, showEmpty }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.length === 0 && showEmpty && <li>No items</li>}
      {items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Why doesn't the browser understand JSX directly?"* — JSX isn't part of the JavaScript spec at all. It's a syntax extension only build tooling (Babel, a bundler's built-in transform) understands, which is why a JSX file always needs a build step before it can run in a browser.
- *"Why is `{condition && <Component />}` common in JSX instead of an `if` statement?"* — JSX expressions inside `{}` must be expressions, not statements. `if` is a statement, so it can't go directly inside JSX curly braces — a short-circuiting expression (`&&`, a ternary) is the idiomatic way to write a conditional inline within markup.

### 3. What Is a Component, and How Do Props Flow Through One?

**Core answer:**

"A component is a JavaScript function that accepts a single argument — conventionally destructured as `props` — and returns JSX describing what should render. Props are how data flows from a parent into a child: a parent passes them as JSX attributes (`<UserCard name="Alex" age={30} />`), and the child receives them as its function argument, read-only from the child's side. A child should never mutate the props object it receives, since that object might be the exact same reference the parent is holding and rendering from. This one-directional flow — data only flows down, parent to child, never back up through props — is a deliberate design choice, not a limitation. A child that needs to affect a parent's state does it by calling a function the parent passed down as a prop, not by writing to its own props."

**Staff-level extension:**

The real reason one-way data flow matters at scale, beyond "it's the rule": if data could flow both ways through the same channel, tracing where a value's current state actually came from means following both the downward prop passing and any upward mutation paths at once — that gets intractable fast in a large tree. One-way flow means you can always trace a value's origin by walking up the tree exactly once, toward whichever ancestor owns it. This is also exactly why "lifting state up" (covered later) is React's answer when two sibling components need to share or coordinate state — instead of one sibling reaching across to mutate the other directly, which the one-way model doesn't allow, the shared state moves up to their common parent, and both siblings get it (plus a callback to change it) as props.

**Example:**

```jsx
function UserCard({ name, age }) { // props received as a plain function argument, destructured
  return <p>{name}, age {age}</p>;
}

function App() {
  return <UserCard name="Alex" age={30} />; // data flows DOWN from App into UserCard via props
}

// A child affecting a parent: NOT by writing to props, but by calling a
// function the parent explicitly passed down.
function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return <Child onIncrement={() => setCount(count + 1)} />;
}
function Child({ onIncrement }) {
  return <button onClick={onIncrement}>Increment parent's count</button>;
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"What happens if a child component mutates a prop object directly, e.g. `props.user.name = 'new'`?"* — Since the prop is very likely the same object reference the parent holds, this silently mutates the parent's data too, bypassing React's state-update mechanism entirely. The UI may not even re-render, since nothing told React a state update happened.
- *"How does a deeply nested descendant get data from a distant ancestor without every intermediate component needing that prop?"* — Passing it down through every layer is called prop drilling. Context (covered later) is React's built-in answer once prop drilling gets impractical.

### 4. How Does the `useState` Hook Work?

**Core answer:**

"`useState(initialValue)` gives a function component a piece of state that persists across re-renders — something a plain local variable can't do, since the whole function body re-runs from scratch on every render and would reset a plain variable back to its initial value each time. It returns an array of exactly two items: the current value and a setter function. Calling the setter with a new value schedules a re-render, and on that next render `useState` returns the new value instead of the old one. One easy-to-miss detail: calling the setter doesn't mutate the state variable in place, and it doesn't change the value available in the currently-running function — the update is scheduled, and the new value only shows up starting from the next render. That's why reading the state variable again right after calling its setter, in the same function call, still shows the old value."

**Staff-level extension:**

The mechanism worth being able to explain, not just the symptom: React associates each `useState` call with a specific "slot" in that component instance's state, tracked by the *order* Hooks are called in during render. That's why Hooks must be called unconditionally, at the top level, never inside a conditional, loop, or nested function — a different number or order of Hooks between renders would misalign which stored value belongs to which `useState` call. Functional updates (`setCount(prev => prev + 1)` instead of `setCount(count + 1)`) matter when multiple updates to the same state might be scheduled before a re-render happens — passing a function guarantees each update sees the actual latest pending value, not a stale value captured in the closure from when the handler was created. `useReducer` is worth naming as `useState`'s sibling for a reason beyond "it's for complex state": once several `setState` calls in the same handler need to change together as one atomic transition, a reducer's single function encodes exactly which combinations of state are valid — where several separate `useState` calls, updated ad hoc, can drift into an inconsistent combination no single call site fully controls.

**Example:**

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  function handleTripleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1); // BUG: all three reference the same stale `count` from this render — ends at count + 1, not +3
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  function handleTripleClickCorrect() {
    setCount(prev => prev + 1); // each functional update sees the latest pending value — ends at count + 3
    setCount(prev => prev + 1);
    setCount(prev => prev + 1);
  }

  return <button onClick={handleTripleClickCorrect}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Why does calling the setter three times in a row with `count + 1` not increment by 3?"* — All three calls in the same handler close over the same `count` value from that render — none sees the others' effect until the next render — so they all schedule the same "set to `count + 1`" update, not three sequential increments.
- *"Why must Hooks be called unconditionally, at the top level, never inside an `if`?"* — React tracks which `useState`/`useEffect` call maps to which internal slot purely by the order they're called during render. A conditional Hook call would change that order between renders and silently misalign every subsequent Hook's stored value.
- *"When would you reach for `useReducer` instead of `useState`?"* — When a piece of state's next value depends on more than just "the new value passed in" — several related sub-values changing together in response to a small set of named actions, or a next state that depends on the previous one in a non-trivial way. A reducer centralizes that logic in one place instead of scattering it across every call site.

### 5. What's the Difference Between a Controlled and an Uncontrolled Input?

**Core answer:**

"A controlled input's value is driven entirely by React state — the input's `value` attribute is bound to a state variable, and an `onChange` handler updates that state on every keystroke. React state is always the single source of truth for what the input shows, and the DOM element itself has no independent memory of its own value. An uncontrolled input instead manages its own value in the DOM, the way a plain HTML input normally would — React only reads that value when it needs it, typically via a `ref` on form submission, rather than tracking every keystroke through state. Controlled inputs are generally preferred when the value needs validating, transforming, or reacting to as the user types, or when several UI elements need to stay in sync with it. Uncontrolled inputs are simpler and cheaper per keystroke, which can matter for a very large or performance-sensitive form, at the cost of not having that value available in state until you go read it."

**Staff-level extension:**

The performance trade-off worth naming: a controlled input triggers a React re-render on every keystroke, since `onChange` calls a state setter each time. That's fine for the vast majority of forms, but it can become a real cost in a form with many controlled inputs re-rendering together, or an input feeding an expensive computation on every change. The fix usually isn't "switch to uncontrolled" — it's debouncing the expensive downstream work (an API call, a heavy validation function) while keeping the input itself controlled for correctness and immediate feedback. React 19's Actions and form hooks (covered later) offer a third pattern for form submission specifically — reading a native `FormData` object from an uncontrolled-style form on submit — which skips per-keystroke state entirely for cases where only the submitted values matter, not the live keystroke-by-keystroke value.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Controlled — React state is the source of truth
function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');
  return <input value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}

// Uncontrolled — the DOM manages its own value; React reads it via a ref only when needed
function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = React.useRef(null);
  function handleSubmit() {
    console.log(inputRef.current.value); // read only at submission time, not on every keystroke
  }
  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} defaultValue="" />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"What happens if you set an input's `value` prop without also providing an `onChange` handler?"* — React logs a console warning, and the input becomes read-only from the user's perspective, since nothing updates the state backing `value` — every keystroke gets immediately overwritten back on the next render.
- *"When would you deliberately choose an uncontrolled input?"* — A very large form where per-keystroke re-renders would be a measurable cost, or a simple form where only the final submitted values matter and no live validation is needed.

### 6. Why Does React Need a `key` Prop When Rendering a List?

**Core answer:**

"When React reconciles a list against its previous render, `key` is what lets it tell which item is which across renders. Without a stable, unique `key`, React falls back to comparing elements purely by position in the list, which breaks down the moment the list gets reordered, filtered, or has an item inserted or removed anywhere but the end. React will think whatever's now at a given position is the same item that used to be there, and can reuse the wrong DOM node's internal state — an input's typed text, a checkbox's checked state, a component's local `useState` — for what's actually a different logical item. A `key` should be a stable, unique identifier tied to the item's real identity, typically an ID from a database, not the array index and not a freshly-generated random value — both defeat the purpose `key` exists for."

**Staff-level extension:**

The concrete failure mode worth being able to describe, since "use a real ID, not the index" undersells why it matters: if a list item holds its own local state — an uncontrolled input's value, an open/closed toggle, a component's `useState` — and the list gets reordered or has a middle item removed while using array index as `key`, React matches the wrong DOM node (and its state) to the wrong logical item after the reorder. Visually, a checkbox that was checked on "item C" can end up looking checked on "item B" after "item A" is deleted, because React saw "the element at index 0" persist and reused its state, never realizing the underlying data at that position had actually changed. Index-as-key isn't always wrong — for a list that's genuinely static, never reordered or filtered, and only ever appended to at the end, index and stable-ID keys behave identically. But betting that assumption holds forever in code other people will maintain is fragile, which is why a stable ID stays the default even when index would technically work today.

**Example:**

```jsx
// BROKEN: index as key — breaks if `todos` is ever reordered or filtered
function TodoListBroken({ todos }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo, index) => (
        <li key={index}>
          <input type="checkbox" defaultChecked={todo.done} /> {todo.text}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

// CORRECT: a stable identifier from the data itself
function TodoList({ todos }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id}>
          <input type="checkbox" defaultChecked={todo.done} /> {todo.text}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Is it ever acceptable to use the array index as `key`?"* — Yes, for a list that's provably static — never reordered, filtered, or modified anywhere but appended to at the end. A stable ID is still the safer default, since that assumption is easy to accidentally violate later.
- *"Why not generate a new random key on every render instead of using the index?"* — That defeats `key`'s purpose from the other direction. If the key changes every render even for the same logical item, React treats it as a brand new element every time, destroying and recreating its DOM node — and losing its state — on every render, which is worse than the index problem.

## Intermediate

### 7. How Does `useEffect` Work, and What Is the Cleanup Function For?

**Core answer:**

"`useEffect(fn, dependencies)` lets a component run code that synchronizes with something outside React's own rendering — subscribing to an external data source, setting up a timer, manipulating the DOM directly, making an API call — after React has committed the render to the DOM. The dependency array controls when the effect re-runs: React compares each dependency's value against the previous render, and only re-runs the effect if at least one changed. An empty array `[]` means the effect runs once, after the first render; omitting the array means it runs after every render. If the effect returns another function, React treats that as cleanup — calling it right before the effect runs again (if its dependencies changed) and when the component unmounts. That's exactly where you reverse whatever the effect set up: unsubscribing, clearing a timer, removing a listener, aborting an in-flight request — the same cleanup responsibility as `ngOnDestroy()` in Angular."

**Staff-level extension:**

A commonly-tested subtlety worth stating exactly: the cleanup function isn't only for unmount. It runs before *every* re-execution of the effect, not just the final one. That's what makes `useEffect` safe for subscriptions whose target can change — a WebSocket connection tied to a room ID that can change, a timer whose interval prop can change — since each time the effect re-runs, the previous subscription gets cleaned up first, then the new one gets established, instead of accumulating several at once. React 18's Strict Mode deliberately mounts, unmounts, and remounts a component once extra in development specifically to surface effects with missing or broken cleanup. A component whose effect doesn't clean up properly will visibly misbehave under Strict Mode — a duplicated subscription, a doubled counter — even though it might seem to "work" without it. That's a deliberate choice, to catch this class of bug before it reaches production.

**Example:**

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId); // set up
    connection.connect();

    return () => {
      connection.disconnect(); // cleanup — runs before the next effect execution AND on unmount
    };
  }, [roomId]); // re-runs (cleanup old connection, establish new one) whenever roomId changes

  return <p>Connected to {roomId}</p>;
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"What happens if you forget the dependency array entirely, versus passing an empty array?"* — Omitting it re-runs the effect after every render, which for a subscription or timer means creating a brand-new one each time without properly cleaning up the prior one. An empty array runs the effect exactly once, after the initial render.
- *"Why does React's Strict Mode intentionally mount, unmount, and remount a component in development?"* — To surface effects with missing or buggy cleanup. A component whose effect cleans up properly behaves identically whether it's mounted once or mounted-unmounted-remounted, so any visible difference — like a duplicated subscription — is a real bug Strict Mode is designed to catch in development rather than production.

### 8. What Problem Does the Context API Solve?

**Core answer:**

"Context lets a value be available to an entire subtree of components without manually passing it down as a prop through every intermediate component that doesn't itself need it. That's the same "prop drilling" problem from the earlier props question, where a value needed by a deeply nested descendant would otherwise have to be threaded through every layer in between. You create a `Context` object with `createContext(defaultValue)`, wrap the relevant subtree in a `<Context.Provider value={...}>`, and any descendant — no matter how deep — reads it directly with `useContext(Context)`, skipping every intermediate layer. Common real uses are things genuinely global to a large subtree or the whole app: the current authenticated user, a UI theme, the active locale. Passing those down explicitly through many components that never touch them would just be pointless boilerplate."

**Staff-level extension:**

The trade-off worth naming: Context isn't a general-purpose state-management replacement for something like Redux or Zustand, and treating it as one has a real cost. Every component calling `useContext(Context)` re-renders whenever the Provider's `value` changes, with no built-in way to subscribe to just part of it — so a Context holding several unrelated pieces of state re-renders every consumer whenever any of them changes, even ones a given consumer never reads. The fix is splitting a large Context into several narrower ones scoped to logically-related state, so unrelated updates don't cause unrelated re-renders — and for state that changes frequently or needs fine-grained subscriptions, reaching for a dedicated state-management library instead. Context is the right tool for infrequently-changing, broadly-needed values, not high-frequency application state.

**Example:**

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light'); // default value, used if no Provider is above

function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('dark');
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <Toolbar /> {/* Toolbar itself never touches theme — no prop drilling needed */}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return <ThemedButton />; // passes through without needing to know about theme at all
}

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext); // reads directly, skipping Toolbar entirely
  return <button className={theme}>Click me</button>;
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"What re-renders when a Context's `value` changes?"* — Every component calling `useContext` on that Context, regardless of which part of the value it actually reads. There's no built-in partial-subscription mechanism, which is the main reason Context isn't a drop-in replacement for a full state-management library.
- *"How would you avoid unnecessary re-renders if a Context holds multiple pieces of unrelated state?"* — Split it into several narrower Context objects, each holding logically-related state, so a component only re-renders when the specific Context it actually consumes changes.

### 9. What's the Difference Between `useMemo` and `useCallback`?

**Core answer:**

"Both exist to skip unnecessary recomputation across re-renders, and both take a dependency array with the same re-run semantics as `useEffect`, but they memoize different things. `useMemo(fn, deps)` caches the *return value* of calling `fn`, recomputing it only when a dependency changes — useful for an expensive calculation, like filtering or sorting a large array, that would otherwise re-run on every render even when its inputs haven't changed. `useCallback(fn, deps)` caches the *function reference itself*, returning the same function instance across renders as long as dependencies haven't changed, instead of a new function object being created every render (which is what happens by default whenever you define a function inside a component body). `useCallback` matters because a new function reference on every render can defeat `React.memo`'s reference-equality check on a child receiving that function as a prop, causing the child to re-render even when nothing it actually cares about changed."

**Staff-level extension:**

Worth stating directly: both hooks are *optimizations*, not correctness requirements. Skipping either one doesn't produce a wrong result — a non-memoized value or function just gets recomputed or recreated on every render, which is what would happen anyway without the hook. The only cost is potentially wasted work — an expensive recalculation, or a downstream `React.memo`'d child re-rendering unnecessarily — never incorrect behavior. That's exactly why reaching for `useMemo`/`useCallback` everywhere "just in case" is itself an anti-pattern: each has its own small bookkeeping cost, and applying them to a cheap computation, or a function passed to a component that isn't itself memoized, adds complexity for no benefit. The judgment call is measuring an actual, demonstrated cost — a slow render, a profiler-confirmed unnecessary re-render — before reaching for either. The React Compiler, covered later, exists specifically to automate this judgment call away in the common case.

**Example:**

```jsx
function ProductList({ products, onSelect }) {
  // useMemo: caches the computed VALUE — avoids re-sorting on every render
  const sorted = React.useMemo(
    () => [...products].sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price),
    [products]
  );

  // useCallback: caches the FUNCTION REFERENCE — lets React.memo below actually skip re-rendering
  const handleSelect = React.useCallback(
    (id) => onSelect(id),
    [onSelect]
  );

  return sorted.map(p => <ProductRow key={p.id} product={p} onSelect={handleSelect} />);
}

const ProductRow = React.memo(function ProductRow({ product, onSelect }) {
  // Without useCallback above, `onSelect` would be a NEW function reference every
  // ProductList render, defeating React.memo here — this component would re-render every time regardless.
  return <button onClick={() => onSelect(product.id)}>{product.name}</button>;
});
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"If you remove `useCallback` from the example above, does the app produce a wrong result?"* — No — `ProductRow` would just re-render more often than necessary, since `React.memo`'s reference-equality check on `onSelect` would fail every time. The behavior stays correct, just less efficient.
- *"When is `useMemo`/`useCallback` actually not worth using?"* — For a cheap computation, or a function passed to a component that isn't itself wrapped in `React.memo`. In both cases the memoization's own overhead isn't offset by any real savings, since there's nothing expensive being skipped.

### 10. What Is a Custom Hook, and When Would You Write One?

**Core answer:**

"A custom Hook is simply a JavaScript function whose name starts with `use` and that calls one or more of React's built-in Hooks internally — a mechanism for extracting and reusing *stateful logic* between components, as opposed to a regular utility function, which can share plain logic but can't itself hold state or use other Hooks outside a component or another Hook. A custom Hook doesn't share state between the components that use it — each call gets its own, entirely independent instance of whatever state it manages internally, the same as if that logic were written directly inline in each component; what's shared is the *logic*, not a single piece of state. Common real reasons to extract one: the same stateful pattern (a `useEffect`-plus-`useState` combination for tracking window size, fetching data with loading/error states, debouncing a value) is duplicated verbatim across multiple components, or a component's own logic has grown complex enough that separating a self-contained piece into a named Hook makes the component's body easier to read."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise distinction worth being explicit about at Staff level: a custom Hook is not a lifecycle-independent singleton or a shared store — calling `useWindowSize()` in three different components creates three entirely separate `useState`/`useEffect` instances, each with its own independent state and its own independent subscription/cleanup, not one shared value magically available everywhere (that's what Context or a dedicated store solves instead, a genuinely different problem). The naming convention (`use` prefix) isn't cosmetic — it's what allows the linter (`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`) to enforce the Rules of Hooks specifically on that function, catching the same class of bugs (conditional Hook calls, calling Hooks outside a component or another Hook) it enforces on built-in Hooks — a function containing Hook calls that isn't named with a `use` prefix won't get that safety check applied, which is a real, easy-to-miss source of subtle Hook-order bugs.

**Example:**

```jsx
function useWindowSize() {
  const [size, setSize] = React.useState({ width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight });

  React.useEffect(() => {
    function handleResize() {
      setSize({ width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight });
    }
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize); // cleanup, per the useEffect question above
  }, []);

  return size;
}

// Each component using this Hook gets its OWN independent size state and listener:
function Header() {
  const { width } = useWindowSize();
  return <header>{width < 600 ? 'Mobile header' : 'Desktop header'}</header>;
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"If two components both call `useWindowSize()`, do they share the same `size` value?"* — No — each call creates its own completely independent `useState` and `useEffect` instance; they'll compute the same value since they're both reading `window.innerWidth`, but they're not sharing state, they're duplicating equivalent, independently-tracked state.
- *"Why must a custom Hook's name start with `use`?"* — It's the signal that lets the Rules-of-Hooks linter recognize the function as a Hook and apply the same static checks (no conditional calls, no calls outside a component/another Hook) it applies to React's own built-in Hooks — without the prefix, those checks silently don't apply.

### 11. What Are Refs For, and How Do They Differ From State?

**Core answer:**

"A ref, created with `useRef(initialValue)`, holds a mutable value in an object with a single `.current` property that persists across re-renders — the same persistence guarantee `useState` provides — but changing a ref's `.current` does not trigger a re-render, and reading it does not need to go through any React re-render cycle at all. This makes refs the right tool for exactly two common cases: holding a mutable value that the component's rendered output doesn't actually depend on (a timer ID to clear later, a previous value for comparison, a mutable flag), and accessing an actual underlying DOM node directly (focusing an input, measuring an element's size, integrating a non-React library that needs a real DOM element) via `<div ref={myRef}>`, after which `myRef.current` is the actual DOM node. State should be used for anything the component's rendered UI needs to reflect; refs should be used for anything that needs to persist and be mutable but should not, by itself, cause the component to re-render when it changes."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise reason using a ref for something that *should* affect the rendered output is a real, common bug worth being able to name exactly: since updating `.current` doesn't trigger a re-render, the DOM will keep showing stale content even after the ref's value has genuinely changed, until some *other* re-render happens to occur for an unrelated reason and the component happens to read the ref's now-current value during that render — which makes the bug appear intermittent and confusing rather than consistently broken, since it "works" whenever something else coincidentally triggers a re-render. As of React 19, `ref` can be passed as a plain prop directly to function components without `forwardRef` — a real, meaningful ergonomic change from React 18 and earlier, where a function component needed to be explicitly wrapped in `React.forwardRef()` to accept a ref from its parent at all.

**Example:**

```jsx
function Stopwatch() {
  const [running, setRunning] = React.useState(false);
  const intervalRef = React.useRef(null); // holds a timer ID — doesn't need to trigger re-renders itself

  function start() {
    setRunning(true);
    intervalRef.current = setInterval(() => console.log('tick'), 1000);
  }
  function stop() {
    setRunning(false);
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current); // read/cleared without causing any re-render
  }

  return <button onClick={running ? stop : start}>{running ? 'Stop' : 'Start'}</button>;
}

// React 19: ref as a plain prop, no forwardRef needed
function TextInput({ ref, placeholder }) {
  return <input ref={ref} placeholder={placeholder} />;
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"What happens if you use a ref to store a value your JSX actually displays?"* — The displayed value goes stale after the ref changes, since no re-render is triggered — it only updates the next time the component happens to re-render for some unrelated reason, producing a confusing, intermittent-looking bug.
- *"What changed about `ref` and function components in React 19 specifically?"* — Function components can now accept `ref` as a plain named prop directly, without wrapping the component in `React.forwardRef()` — `forwardRef` still works for backward compatibility but is no longer necessary for new code.

### 12. What's the Difference Between Lifting State Up and Prop Drilling?

**Core answer:**

"Lifting state up means moving a piece of state from a child component to their closest common ancestor, so that ancestor can pass both the value and an updater function down to however many children need to read or change it — it's React's standard answer to two sibling components needing to share or stay synchronized on the same state, since siblings can't communicate directly with each other through props at all, only through a shared parent. Prop drilling is the separate, related problem of passing a value down through several layers of intermediate components that don't themselves use that value, purely so it can reach a deeply nested descendant that does — it's not wrong in principle, just increasingly inconvenient and noisy as the number of intermediate layers grows, and it's the specific problem Context (covered earlier) exists to solve for values that need to reach deeply without every layer in between needing to know about them."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise decision boundary worth being able to state clearly at Staff level: lifting state up is about *where state should live* (moving its ownership to the right common ancestor), while Context is about *how a value gets from where it lives to where it's needed* without manually threading it through every intermediate layer — the two aren't alternatives to each other, they solve different parts of the same broader problem, and a real component tree commonly needs both: state lifted to an appropriate ancestor, then made available to distant descendants via Context rather than prop drilling through every layer in between. A genuinely common design mistake is lifting state further up the tree than it needs to go "just in case," which needlessly widens the set of components that re-render when it changes — the correct level to lift state to is the lowest common ancestor that actually needs it, not the application root by default.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Two siblings need synchronized state -> lift it to their common parent
function TemperatureConverter() {
  const [celsius, setCelsius] = React.useState(0); // lifted here — the common ancestor
  return (
    <>
      <CelsiusInput value={celsius} onChange={setCelsius} />
      <FahrenheitDisplay celsius={celsius} /> {/* sibling reads the SAME lifted state */}
    </>
  );
}

function CelsiusInput({ value, onChange }) {
  return <input type="number" value={value} onChange={e => onChange(Number(e.target.value))} />;
}
function FahrenheitDisplay({ celsius }) {
  return <p>{(celsius * 9) / 5 + 32}°F</p>;
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Why can't two sibling components just pass state directly to each other?"* — Props only flow from parent to child, never sideways between siblings — the only path for two siblings to share state is through a common ancestor that owns it and passes it (or an updater) down to both.
- *"If lifting state up and Context solve different problems, when do you need both together?"* — When state needs to be owned by a specific ancestor (lifted appropriately, not too far up) but also needs to reach several deeply nested descendants scattered across the tree — the state lives at the lifted location, and Context is the delivery mechanism to the distant consumers, avoiding prop drilling through every layer in between.

### 13. What Are Error Boundaries, and How Do You Implement One?

**Core answer:**

"An Error Boundary is a component that catches JavaScript errors thrown anywhere in its child component tree during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in a constructor, and renders a fallback UI instead of letting the error crash the entire application. As of this guide's baseline, an Error Boundary must be a class component — there is still no Hooks-based, functional equivalent in React itself — implemented with the static lifecycle method `getDerivedStateFromError(error)`, which updates state to trigger the fallback render, and typically paired with `componentDidCatch(error, info)` for logging. Wrapping a section of the tree in an Error Boundary means a bug in one feature (a chart that throws on malformed data, say) shows a contained fallback for just that section instead of taking down the whole page, which is exactly the same 'isolate the blast radius' instinct as wrapping a single API call in a `try`/`catch` rather than leaving one unhandled failure able to crash everything around it."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise scope boundary worth being able to state exactly, since it's a common source of "why didn't my error boundary catch this" confusion: Error Boundaries only catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the tree below them — they do **not** catch errors in event handlers (a `try`/`catch` inside the handler itself is still required there), errors in asynchronous code (`setTimeout`, a rejected Promise not awaited inside render), errors during server-side rendering, or an error thrown inside the boundary component's own code rather than its children's. The one deliberate exception worth knowing: an error thrown inside `startTransition` *is* caught by an Error Boundary, since React treats that as part of the same rendering work the boundary is already responsible for. Since writing an Error Boundary class from scratch is boilerplate most teams don't want to repeat per feature, the standard practical answer is reaching for the community `react-error-boundary` package, which wraps the same class-based mechanism behind a reusable component and hook-friendly API, rather than every codebase hand-rolling its own.

**Example:**

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true }; // triggers the fallback render on the next pass
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    logErrorToMyService(error, info.componentStack); // side effect — logging, not allowed in getDerivedStateFromError
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) return this.props.fallback;
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

// Usage — isolates a failure in ChartWidget from crashing the rest of the dashboard
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>This chart failed to load.</p>}>
        <ChartWidget />
      </ErrorBoundary>
      <Footer /> {/* still renders even if ChartWidget throws */}
    </>
  );
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Why does React require Error Boundaries to be class components, with no Hooks equivalent?"* — `getDerivedStateFromError` needs to run as part of React's own render-phase error handling before any fallback commits, which depends on the class lifecycle model; no built-in Hooks API currently exposes that same hook point, which is exactly why the community `react-error-boundary` package still implements the boundary itself as a class internally, even though it exposes a friendlier functional wrapper around it.
- *"If an Error Boundary won't catch an error from an `onClick` handler, how do you handle that instead?"* — A regular `try`/`catch` inside the handler itself (or around the `await` if it's async) — the same pattern used for any synchronous or asynchronous error handling outside of rendering, since an Error Boundary's coverage is scoped specifically to the render path.

## Staff Level

### 14. How Does React's Reconciliation Algorithm Actually Work?

**Core answer:**

"React's diffing algorithm is a heuristic, not a general tree-diff — a fully general tree-diffing algorithm is computationally expensive (roughly O(n³) for n nodes in the naive case), so React instead uses two deliberate assumptions that make the common case fast: two elements of different types produce entirely different trees, so React tears down the old subtree and builds a new one from scratch rather than trying to diff their internals at all; and for a list of children, `key` (covered earlier) is what lets React match elements across renders efficiently, rather than falling back to a much more expensive general comparison. Internally, this all runs on top of Fiber, React's reconciliation engine (introduced in React 16) — a data structure representing the component tree as a linked list of 'fiber' nodes that can be processed incrementally, one unit of work at a time, rather than requiring a single, uninterruptible pass through the whole tree — which is precisely what makes concurrent rendering, covered in the next question, possible at all."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise reason Fiber's incremental-unit-of-work model matters, worth being able to state exactly: before Fiber (in React 15 and earlier), reconciliation for a given update ran as one synchronous, uninterruptible pass over the entire affected tree — for a large enough tree, this could block the main thread long enough to visibly drop frames or delay input responsiveness, with no way for React to pause and let something more urgent (a keystroke, an animation frame) happen first. Fiber restructures that same work into small, individually resumable units, letting React's scheduler pause low-priority reconciliation work, yield to the browser to handle something more urgent, and resume where it left off — the tree-diffing heuristics (element-type identity, `key`-based list matching) determine *what* work needs to happen, and Fiber is *how* that work gets scheduled and executed without blocking the main thread for the whole duration.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Different element TYPES at the same position -> React discards the old subtree entirely,
// it does not try to diff <UserProfile>'s internals against <GuestBanner>'s.
function Header({ loggedIn }) {
  return loggedIn ? <UserProfile /> : <GuestBanner />;
  // Switching loggedIn unmounts whichever was rendered and mounts the other fresh —
  // any local state inside UserProfile/GuestBanner is lost on the switch, by design.
}

// SAME element type, different props -> React reuses the existing DOM node and updates only what changed.
function Header2({ title }) {
  return <h1>{title}</h1>; // changing `title` updates the existing <h1>'s text, doesn't recreate the element
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"What's the practical consequence of React tearing down a subtree when the element type changes, rather than diffing it?"* — Any local state inside that subtree (a form's typed values, a toggle's open/closed state) is lost, since the old component instance is unmounted and a genuinely new instance of the other component is mounted in its place, not updated in place.
- *"What specific capability does Fiber's incremental architecture unlock that the pre-Fiber reconciler couldn't do?"* — The ability to pause a render mid-way, let something more urgent run first (like responding to a keystroke), and resume — the foundation concurrent rendering and features like `useTransition`/`Suspense` are built on.

---

### 15. What Is Concurrent Rendering, and How Do `useTransition` and `Suspense` Use It?

**Core answer:**

"Concurrent rendering is the capability, built on Fiber, for React to work on an update in the background — interruptibly, without blocking the main thread — and pause, abandon, or restart that work if something more urgent comes in before it finishes, rather than every update being an uninterruptible, all-or-nothing block. `useTransition` lets a component mark a state update as low-priority ('a transition'): `startTransition(() => setSomeState(newValue))` tells React this update can be interrupted by something more urgent (the next keystroke in a search box), and the hook's `isPending` flag shows a pending indicator while that lower-priority work is still in progress. `Suspense` lets a component 'wait' for something — data, code, an image — to be ready before rendering, showing a fallback in the meantime, built on the same underlying mechanism: React can render other, unrelated parts of the tree while a Suspended part is still waiting, rather than blocking the whole render on one slow piece."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise distinction worth being able to draw exactly at Staff level: concurrent rendering does not make any individual computation faster — it does not parallelize work across CPU cores, and it doesn't reduce the total amount of work React has to do — its value is entirely about *scheduling and interruptibility*: prioritizing urgent updates (a keystroke, a click) over less urgent ones (a large list re-filtering, a heavy derived computation) so the app *feels* more responsive, even though the total work done and total time to complete the low-priority update may be the same or slightly more. A concrete, common Staff-level scenario worth being able to walk through: a search input where every keystroke both updates the input's own displayed text immediately (a high-priority update) and triggers an expensive filter over a large list (wrapped in `startTransition`, a low-priority update) — without the transition, a fast typist's keystrokes would visibly lag behind the expensive re-filtering; with it, the input stays responsive immediately, and the filtered list updates as fast as it can in the background, interruptible by the very next keystroke.

**Example:**

```jsx
function SearchPage({ allItems }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = React.useState('');
  const [isPending, startTransition] = React.useTransition();
  const [results, setResults] = React.useState(allItems);

  function handleChange(e) {
    setQuery(e.target.value); // HIGH priority — input stays responsive immediately

    startTransition(() => {
      // LOW priority — can be interrupted by the next keystroke before it finishes
      setResults(allItems.filter(item => item.name.includes(e.target.value)));
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input value={query} onChange={handleChange} />
      {isPending && <span>Updating results...</span>}
      <ResultsList results={results} />
    </>
  );
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Does wrapping an update in `startTransition` make that update itself complete faster?"* — No — it doesn't reduce the work or speed up the computation itself; it only makes the update interruptible and lower-priority, so more urgent updates aren't blocked behind it, which improves perceived responsiveness, not raw throughput.
- *"Why can React render other parts of the tree while a `Suspense` boundary is still waiting?"* — Because Fiber's incremental, unit-of-work model (from the reconciliation question) lets React work on unrelated parts of the tree independently, rather than the whole render being one indivisible operation blocked entirely on the slowest piece.

### 16. What Does the React Compiler Do, and How Does It Relate to `useMemo`/`useCallback`?

**Core answer:**

"The React Compiler is a build-time tool — a genuinely separate, independently-versioned project from React itself, which reached stable v1.0 in October 2025 — that automatically inserts the equivalent of `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`React.memo`-style memoization into components during compilation, based on static analysis of the component's code, rather than a developer having to identify which values and functions are worth memoizing and wrap them by hand. In a codebase using the Compiler, most manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` calls become unnecessary — the Compiler achieves the same optimization automatically and more consistently, since it can apply the analysis uniformly across the whole codebase rather than depending on a developer remembering to do it, and correctly, in every place it would help. It supports React 17 and newer, ships by default in new Vite, Next.js, and Expo project templates as of its stable release, and is applied at build time via a Babel plugin (or the equivalent in a given build tool), meaning it changes how code compiles, not React's runtime behavior itself."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise scope boundary worth being exact about at Staff level: the Compiler automates *memoization* specifically — skipping unnecessary recomputation and re-renders that plain component code would otherwise trigger — but it does not replace `useState`, `useEffect`, Context, or any other Hook, and it does not change the fundamental rules a component must follow (the Rules of Hooks still apply, and in fact the Compiler relies on code following them to safely analyze it). It's also worth being able to state precisely why manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` isn't simply obsolete even with the Compiler enabled: a codebase not yet fully migrated to the Compiler, a library meant to work standalone without assuming consumers use it, or a specific case the Compiler's static analysis can't safely optimize (some genuinely dynamic patterns) may still need manual memoization — the Compiler is described by the React team as reducing the *need* for manual memoization in the common case, not eliminating hand-written memoization as a valid tool entirely.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Without the Compiler: a developer must remember to memoize manually
function ProductList({ products }) {
  const sorted = React.useMemo(() => [...products].sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price), [products]);
  return sorted.map(p => <ProductRow key={p.id} product={p} />);
}

// With the React Compiler enabled: written the same simple way,
// the Compiler inserts equivalent memoization automatically at build time —
// no useMemo call needed in the source at all.
function ProductListCompiled({ products }) {
  const sorted = [...products].sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price); // Compiler memoizes this automatically
  return sorted.map(p => <ProductRow key={p.id} product={p} />);
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Is the React Compiler part of React's core release, versioned alongside it?"* — No — it's an independently-versioned, separate project (reaching its own stable v1.0 in October 2025) that supports React 17 and newer; a team can adopt a new React Compiler version without that being tied to a specific React version release at all.
- *"Does adopting the Compiler mean deleting all existing `useMemo`/`useCallback` calls immediately?"* — Not necessarily as a first step — existing manual memoization is generally safe to leave in place alongside the Compiler (it becomes redundant, not harmful, in the common case), and the React team's own guidance is to migrate incrementally rather than treating it as a required, immediate cleanup.

### 17. What Are Server Components, and How Do They Differ From Client Components?

**Core answer:**

"A Server Component renders entirely on the server — it can read directly from a database, the filesystem, or an internal API without shipping any of that access code (or the libraries it needs) to the browser at all, and it never re-renders on the client or carries any client-side interactivity (no `useState`, no event handlers, no effects). A Client Component is what 'traditional' React has always been — code that ships to and runs in the browser, can hold state, respond to events, and use browser APIs — and is opted into explicitly with a `'use client'` directive at the top of the file. The practical value: moving data-fetching and non-interactive rendering logic into Server Components reduces the amount of JavaScript actually shipped to the browser (since a Server Component's own code never needs to be sent at all), while Client Components remain exactly where interactivity is genuinely needed — the two compose together in the same tree, with a Server Component able to render a Client Component as a child, and pass it serializable props."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise architectural boundary worth being exact about, since it's a common point of confusion: Server Components are not the same thing as traditional server-side rendering (SSR) — SSR (also fully supported, and often combined with Server Components) renders a Client Component's initial HTML on the server for faster first paint, but that component's *code* still ships to the browser afterward and re-renders there (hydration); a Server Component's code never ships to the client at all, under any circumstance — it's not "rendered first on the server, then again on the client," it exists exclusively on the server, full stop. It's also important to be precise that the underlying React Server Components (RSC) bundler/wire-format APIs that make this possible are not yet semver-stable on their own — using Server Components in practice, as of this guide's baseline, means going through a framework (most commonly Next.js's App Router) that has integrated those APIs, rather than assembling the RSC machinery directly from React's raw APIs in a custom setup.

**Example:**

```jsx
// ProductDetails.jsx — a Server Component (no 'use client' directive)
// Runs ONLY on the server — this database import and query never reach the browser bundle at all.
import { db } from './db';

async function ProductDetails({ id }) {

  return <button onClick={() => setAdded(true)}>{added ? 'Added!' : 'Add to Cart'}</button>;
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Can a Server Component use `useState` or an `onClick` handler?"* — No — those require running in the browser, which a Server Component never does; any component needing state, effects, or event handlers must be a Client Component.
- *"Is React Server Components the same feature as server-side rendering (SSR)?"* — No, and conflating them is a common mistake — SSR produces server-rendered HTML for a component whose code still ships to and re-executes in the browser afterward; a Server Component's code never ships to the browser at all, under any circumstance.

### 18. What Are Actions and `useActionState`, and What Problem Do They Solve?

**Core answer:**

"Actions are React 19's built-in pattern for handling async operations that update state — most commonly form submissions — where a function passed to a `<form>`'s `action` prop (or a button's `formAction`) automatically gets the form's data, and React automatically manages the pending state and error handling around it, rather than a developer manually wiring up `event.preventDefault()`, reading form values, tracking a loading boolean, and catching errors by hand every time. `useActionState(actionFn, initialState)` (renamed from `useFormState` during React 19's stabilization) wraps such a function and returns the current state, a version of the action wired up for use as a form's `action`, and a pending flag — giving a component the current result/error state and a pending indicator without separate manual `useState` calls to track each of those independently. `useFormStatus` is a related hook, callable from a child of the `<form>`, that reports the enclosing form's pending status without that child needing the action function or state passed down to it as props at all."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise problem this replaces, worth naming directly: before Actions, a form submission handler in React typically needed several separate, manually-coordinated pieces — a `useState` for the pending/loading flag, another for any error message, `event.preventDefault()`, manually reading each field's value (or constructing a `FormData` from the event), and manual `try`/`catch`/`finally` to set pending back to false and populate the error state — Actions consolidate that entire pattern into one function and one hook, since `useActionState` handles the pending tracking and result/error state automatically based on the action function's own resolution or thrown error. It's also worth being precise that Actions work with native browser form semantics — a form using an Action still functions (submits, at minimum) even before JavaScript has finished loading/hydrating on the client, in frameworks that support this via progressive enhancement, which a purely `onSubmit`-plus-`preventDefault()`-based handler cannot do at all.

**Example:**

```jsx
async function updateName(previousState, formData) {
  const name = formData.get('name');
  if (!name) return { error: 'Name is required' };
  await saveNameToServer(name);
  return { error: null, success: true };
}

function NameForm() {
  const [state, formAction, isPending] = React.useActionState(updateName, { error: null });

  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      <input name="name" />
      <button disabled={isPending}>{isPending ? 'Saving...' : 'Save'}</button>
      {state.error && <p>{state.error}</p>}
    </form>
  );
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"What did `useActionState` used to be called, and why does that matter for reading older code/tutorials?"* — It was named `useFormState` during React's experimental/canary period before React 19's stable release renamed it — material referencing `useFormState` predates the rename and refers to the same underlying hook.
- *"How does `useFormStatus` differ from reading the pending flag `useActionState` returns directly?"* — `useFormStatus` is callable from a *child* component nested inside the `<form>`, without that child needing the action function, state, or pending flag passed down to it as props at all — useful for a reusable submit-button component that needs to know its enclosing form's pending status without being tightly coupled to that specific form's action.

### 19. How Would You Optimize the Performance of a Large React Application?

**Core answer:**

"I'd work through this in layers, starting with the changes that need the least specialized tooling. First, avoiding unnecessary re-renders: `React.memo` on components that re-render often with unchanged props, paired with `useMemo`/`useCallback` (or the React Compiler handling this automatically, covered earlier) so memoized components' reference-equality checks actually hold. Second, code splitting: `React.lazy()` plus `Suspense` to split rarely-needed or route-specific code into separate bundles loaded on demand, rather than shipping the entire application's JavaScript up front. Third, for a very large list specifically, virtualization — rendering only the list items currently visible in the viewport (plus a small buffer), via a library like `react-window` or `TanStack Virtual`, rather than rendering every item in a list of thousands, which no amount of memoization alone fixes, since the cost there is DOM node count itself, not re-render frequency."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise judgment worth demonstrating at Staff level is knowing which of these actually addresses a given bottleneck, since they solve genuinely different problems: memoization (`React.memo`/`useMemo`/`useCallback`/the Compiler) addresses *unnecessary re-computation and re-rendering* of components whose inputs haven't meaningfully changed; code splitting addresses *initial bundle size and load time*, not runtime rendering performance at all; and virtualization addresses *DOM node count* for very large lists, a problem no amount of memoization fixes since even a perfectly memoized component still costs something to keep mounted in the DOM if there are thousands of them simultaneously. The correct starting point, before applying any of these speculatively, is React DevTools' Profiler — recording an interaction and inspecting exactly which components rendered, how long each took, and why (a changed prop, a changed piece of context, a parent re-render) — since applying memoization or virtualization to a component that wasn't actually the bottleneck adds real complexity for no measured benefit.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Code splitting: this route's code loads only when navigated to
const ReportsPage = React.lazy(() => import('./ReportsPage'));

function App() {
  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
      <ReportsPage />
    </React.Suspense>
  );
}

// Virtualization: renders only the visible slice of a 10,000-item list,
// not all 10,000 DOM nodes at once
import { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window';

function BigList({ items }) {
  return (
    <FixedSizeList height={600} itemCount={items.length} itemSize={35} width="100%">
      {({ index, style }) => <div style={style}>{items[index].name}</div>}
    </FixedSizeList>
  );
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Would memoizing every component in a large list fix a slow-scrolling performance problem?"* — Not by itself — if the underlying issue is thousands of simultaneously-mounted DOM nodes, memoization reduces unnecessary re-renders of those nodes but doesn't reduce how many exist in the DOM at once; virtualization addresses that specific cost directly.
- *"What's the risk of applying `React.memo`/`useMemo` speculatively, without profiling first?"* — Real added code complexity and a small per-use overhead with no measured benefit if the component wasn't actually re-rendering unnecessarily or wasn't expensive to begin with — profiling first avoids optimizing a part of the app that was never actually the bottleneck.

### 20. How Would You Approach State Management in a Large React Application?

**Core answer:**

"I'd separate state into categories first, since they call for different tools, rather than reaching for one library to hold everything. Local UI state (a toggle, a form's in-progress values, a dropdown's open/closed state) belongs in `useState`/`useReducer` on the component that owns it. State shared across a few related components belongs lifted up to their common ancestor, delivered via props or, if it needs to reach distant descendants, via Context. Genuinely global client state used broadly across the app (the current user, app-wide UI preferences) can go through Context if it changes infrequently, or a dedicated lightweight store (Zustand, Redux, and similar) if it changes frequently enough that Context's re-render-everything-on-change behavior (covered in the Context question) becomes a real cost. Server state — data fetched from an API, which has its own caching, staleness, and refetching concerns that don't map cleanly onto client state tools at all — is generally best handled by a dedicated data-fetching library (TanStack Query, SWR, or a framework's built-in equivalent) rather than manually reimplemented with `useState`/`useEffect`."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise distinction worth being explicit about at Staff level is that server state and client state are genuinely different problems, not the same problem at different scales — server state has its own concerns (cache invalidation, background refetching, deduplicating identical in-flight requests, handling staleness) that a generic client-state tool like Redux or a plain Context wasn't designed to solve, and manually reimplementing them with `useState`/`useEffect` (a loading flag, an error state, a manual `useEffect` fetch, no caching or deduplication across components requesting the same data) reproduces a worse, unmaintained version of what a dedicated data-fetching library already provides. The judgment worth demonstrating, mirroring the equivalent NgRx-vs-Signal-service trade-off from the Angular guide, is not defaulting to the most powerful/global tool available — Redux's strict unidirectional flow and time-travel debugging are genuinely valuable for a large team needing enforced consistency across many features touching shared state, but that overhead isn't worth paying for state a Context or even local `useState` would handle perfectly well.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Server state: a dedicated data-fetching library handles caching, refetching,
// and loading/error state automatically — not reimplemented by hand
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const { data: user, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['user', userId],
    queryFn: () => fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`).then(r => r.json()),
  });

  if (isLoading) return <Spinner />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;
  return <p>{user.name}</p>;
}
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Why not just fetch server data with `useEffect` and `useState`, the way it's often first taught?"* — That approach lacks caching (refetches on every mount, even for data another component already fetched), request deduplication, background refetching, and standardized loading/error state — a dedicated library provides all of this without hand-rolling and re-testing it per feature.
- *"What would specifically justify introducing Redux over Context plus local state?"* — A concrete need Context/local state can't cleanly meet — enforced unidirectional update patterns across a large team, time-travel debugging, or genuinely complex cross-feature state interactions — not "Redux is the standard choice" as a reason by itself.

### 21. How Do You Test a React Component?

**Core answer:**

"React Testing Library is the standard tool for component-level tests, and its guiding philosophy is deliberately different from testing a component's internal implementation details: it encourages querying and interacting with a rendered component the way an actual user would — finding elements by their visible text, label, or accessibility role, rather than by internal state, prop values, or CSS class names — and asserting on what's visible in the rendered output, not on a component's internal variables. `render()` renders a component into a virtual DOM for testing; `screen.getByRole()`/`getByText()` and similar queries find elements the way a user or assistive technology would locate them; and `fireEvent`/`userEvent` (the latter more accurately simulating real browser event sequences) simulates user interactions like clicks and typing. This approach means a test keeps passing through internal refactors (renaming a state variable, restructuring how a component is composed internally) as long as the component's actual user-facing behavior hasn't changed — and, conversely, a test written this way should fail if the user-facing behavior breaks, even if the internal implementation looks unchanged."

**Staff-level extension:**

The precise philosophical reason "query by role/text, not by implementation detail" matters at Staff level, worth being able to articulate directly rather than just following the convention: a test that reaches into a component's internal state or queries by a CSS class name/`data-testid` used only for testing is coupled to implementation details a refactor is likely to change even when user-facing behavior is unaffected — which produces the exact false-positive test failure this guide's Testing guide's mock/stub question warns about in a different form: a test failing for a reason that doesn't indicate an actual bug, costing real time to investigate and eroding trust in the test suite. `userEvent` over `fireEvent` is the more Staff-level-aware default specifically because `fireEvent` dispatches a single, synthetic DOM event directly, while `userEvent` simulates the fuller, more realistic sequence of events a real browser interaction actually produces (focus, keydown, keypress, input, keyup for typing a character, for instance) — catching bugs tied to that fuller event sequence that a single synthetic event would miss entirely.

**Example:**

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

function LoginForm({ onSubmit }) {
  const [username, setUsername] = React.useState('');
  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => { e.preventDefault(); onSubmit(username); }}>
      <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
      <input id="username" value={username} onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)} />
      <button type="submit">Log in</button>
    </form>
  );
}

describe('LoginForm', () => {
  it('calls onSubmit with the typed username', async () => {
    const handleSubmit = vi.fn();
    render(<LoginForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />);

    // Queries by ACCESSIBLE role/label — not by internal state or a CSS class
    await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText('Username'), 'alex');
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Log in' }));

    expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith('alex'); // asserts on observable BEHAVIOR, not internal state
  });
});
```

**Follow-up questions:**

- *"Why does React Testing Library discourage querying by CSS class name or component internal state?"* — Both are implementation details a refactor can change without any actual user-facing behavior changing — a test coupled to them can fail for reasons unrelated to a real bug, which wastes investigation time and erodes confidence in what a test failure actually means.
- *"What's a concrete case where `userEvent` catches a bug that `fireEvent` would miss?"* — A component relying on a `focus` or intermediate `keydown` event (some custom keyboard-shortcut handling, an input mask reacting mid-keystroke) — `fireEvent` dispatching only a single synthetic event skips those intermediate events entirely, while `userEvent` fires the fuller, realistic sequence a real user's interaction produces.
